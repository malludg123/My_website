                As we all know HTML is a language of the web. It’s used to design the web pages or we can say structure
                 the page layouts of a website.  HTML stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, as its full form suggests
                  it’s not any programming language, a markup language. So, while the execution of HTML code 
                  we can’t face any such error. In real HTML code wasn’t compiled or interpreted 
                  because HTML code was rendered by the browser. which is similar to the compilation of a program.
                   Html content is parched through the browser to display the content of HTML.

                Html used predefined tags and attributes to tell the browser how to display content, 
                means in which format, style, font size, and images to display. Html is a case insensitive language. 
                Case insensitive means there is no difference in upper case and lower case ( capital and small letters) both treated as the same, for r example ‘D’ and ‘d’ both are the same here. 
                There are generally two types of tags in HTML:

                CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user, 
                and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, 
                importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance, and property definition. 
                CSS style information can be in a separate document, or it can be embedded into an HTML document.

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, 
                color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other 
                decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with 
                the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling 
                to HTML.
